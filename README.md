# UciCreditDefault

Data analysis on a simulated credit card default dataset.

This repository demonstrates the author's journey and growth in the fields of data analysis and data science. The initial Python program was coursework submitted for a Machine Learning class. It showcased a basic understanding of data preparation and machine learning principles.

The author is now revisiting and enhancing the project while completing the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/dataanalytics/). This updated version incorporates best practices learned from the course, including improved data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Showcase personal growth in data analysis and data science.
- Apply new knowledge from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
- Provide a comparative view of initial versus updated approaches to data analysis.

## Dataset Attribution

This project uses the UCI Credit Card Default dataset:

## Current Progress
The project currently includes:
1. Raw Dataset:
   - Directly downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Cleaned Dataset:
   - Includes the altest cleaned version (v4.3.3) with:
     - Consolidated ambiguous values in education column.
     - Converted numerical columns (marraige, sex) to textual labels.
     - Added new column Pay Status Word, for clearer interpretation of Pay_x values.

## Progress and Changelog

Detailed cleaning and transformation steps are documented in [changelog/progress.md](changelog/progress.md).


## Future Additions
1. Machine Learning Initial Project and result.
2. Current Data Analysis: Visualization and insights from the cleaned data will be added as the project progresses.
